# Handwritten-Text-Recognition

<p>Text recognition in handwritten documents has been studied as one of the prominent research areas by different researchers during the last few decades. In this case, OCR is one of the most growing document extraction software today. This is due to the heavy digitization of documents. This has various significant applications in the business and medical fields for recording documents. Although OCR significance is very efficient in recognizing the documents but is not very suitable for Handwritten text. This is due to the high variance in handwriting styles across people and the poor quality of the handwritten text compared to machine-printed text poses significant obstacles in converting it to machine-readable text formats.</p>

<p>This led to the evolution of Handwritten Text Recognition. Handwritten Text Recognition is much needed in this world as of today. The inefficiency in offline recognition of handwritten text, error rate and time consumption by this was highly influential for making Handwritten Text recognition online.</p>

<p>Through this project, we are going to build a machine-learning model for Handwritten Text Recognition. This is capable of extracting words and sentences from the handwritten text. To improve the accuracy and learning ability neural networks are chosen as machine learning models in this project.</p>
